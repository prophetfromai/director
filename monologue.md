# Monologue (Portfolio)

The portfolio-level room temperature. Cross-product ideas, strategic direction, new product thoughts, and themes that don't belong to a single repo.

Every repo also has its own `monologue.md` for product-specific chatter. This one is for the bigger picture.

## Format

Each entry is one line: **who said it**, **what they said** (very few words), and **what it relates to** (product, idea, or theme). Newest at the top.
