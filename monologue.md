# Monologue (Portfolio)

The portfolio-level room temperature. Cross-product ideas, strategic direction, new product thoughts, and themes that don't belong to a single repo.

Every repo also has its own `monologue.md` for product-specific chatter. This one is for the bigger picture.

## Themes

Compacted from older log entries. Persistent signals and recurring interests.

<!-- empty for now -->

## Log
